    Set the policy for what to do to the Virtual Machine once it has been
    determined to be idle.  The choices are to perform a Shutdown or a Suspend.
    The shutdown action will attempt to perform a clean shutdown of the OS.

    It is recommended to perform a Shutdown on the Virtual Machine rather than
    a Suspend.  Suspend should only be used when it is not possible or is
    ill-advised to have the Virtual Machine be shutdown.
